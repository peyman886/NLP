# Evaluating LLMs as a Recommendation System: A Comprehensive Study

This repository contains the work and findings of our project, which explores the capabilities of ChatGPT as a recommendation system across various domains without the need for fine-tuning. Through comprehensive evaluation, we aim to uncover the potential of leveraging large language models like ChatGPT for innovative recommendation approaches.

## Project Structure

- **Jupyter Notebooks:**
  - `Data_processing.ipynb`: Notebook for creating the main dataset from raw data sources.
  - `NLP_Yaghoub_Project.ipynb`: Main evaluation notebook detailing the project's principles, methodologies, and findings.

- **Data Samples:**
  - `sample_data.csv`: Sample dataset extracted for preliminary analysis.
  - `sample_data_gpt.csv`: Sample dataset specifically prepared for ChatGPT evaluation.
  - `subsample_data_llama.csv`: Subsample dataset used for additional analysis with alternative models.

- **Documentation:**
  - `presentation/`: Contains presentation materials and slides.
  - `proposal/`: Includes the initial project proposal document outlining objectives and methodologies.
  - `report/`: Detailed project report with findings, analysis, and conclusions.

## Setup and Installation

To replicate the findings or further explore the project, ensure you have Jupyter Notebooks installed and capable of running Python code. Dependencies specific to the project (e.g., pandas for data manipulation, matplotlib for visualization) are listed at the beginning of each notebook.

## Usage

1. Start by examining `Data_processing.ipynb` to understand how the datasets were prepared.
2. Proceed to `NLP_Yaghoub_Project.ipynb` for a deep dive into the evaluation process, methodologies employed, and insights garnered from the project.
3. Explore the data samples for hands-on analysis and to replicate the study's findings.
