        "\n",
        "Welcome to Assignment #03 in our Natural Language Processing course. In this journey, we're going to dive deep into the fascinating world of generative language models, exploring their capabilities and understanding their inner workings.\n",
        "\n",
        "Generative models have been at the forefront of recent advances in NLP, offering remarkable abilities to generate text, translate languages, and even answer complex questions. They've opened doors to new possibilities, from chatbots that can converse like humans to systems that can write poetic verses or translate between languages with astonishing accuracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this assignment, we will focus on three key areas:\n",
        "1. **Decoding Mechanisms**: We'll start by unraveling the mysteries of how generative models produce text. You'll get hands-on experience with decoding strategies like beam search, learning to tweak them to see how they influence the generated text.\n",
        "2. **Translation Tasks**: Next, we'll delve into the translation capabilities of models, particularly the powerful encoder-decoder structures. You'll experiment with these models, comparing their effectiveness in translating languages.\n",
        "3. **Attention Visualization**: Finally, we'll peek into the \"brain\" of these models by visualizing their attention mechanisms. This will give us a glimpse into how these models focus on different parts of the input to generate coherent and contextually relevant responses.\n",
        "\n",
        "Throughout this assignment, you'll gain not only theoretical knowledge but also practical skills in implementing and manipulating these advanced NLP models. We encourage you to experiment, explore, and even make mistakes - that's the best way to learn!\n",

        "\n",
        "The beam search algorithm is a heuristic search algorithm that explores a graph by expanding the most promising node in a limited set. It's like a breadth-first search that prunes away branches that are less likely to lead to the optimal solution. In the context of language models, it's a technique used to generate text where at each step, instead of considering all possible next tokens, only a specified number of the most probable next tokens (defined by the beam width `k`) are kept. This approach balances between the breadth of the search and computational efficiency, making it possible to generate more coherent and contextually appropriate sequences than a greedy search, which only considers the single best next token at each step.\n"

        "\n",
        "1. **Initialization**: Set up your initial beam containing the tokenized input and an initial score.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Beam Search Loop**:\n",
        "   - For each step until `max_length`, expand each sequence in the current beam to all possible next tokens.\n",
        "   - Calculate the score for each new sequence. This score is typically the product of the probabilities (often converted from logit predictions for numerical stability) of all tokens in the sequence.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Probability Calculation**:\n",
        "   - Implement softmax on the logits to get the probabilities for each token in the vocabulary.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Sequence Expansion**:\n",
        "   - For each sequence in your beam, create new sequences by appending each possible next token.\n",
        "   - Calculate the new score for each sequence.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Candidate Selection**:\n",
        "   - Combine all new sequences from all beam sequences and sort them by their scores.\n",
        "   - Select the top `k` sequences with the highest scores to form the new beam.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Sequence Decoding**:\n",
        "   - Once you reach the `max_length` or all sequences in the beam end with an end-of-sequence token, decode the sequences in the beam to strings.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Output**:\n",
        "   - Return the decoded sequences along with their final scores.\n",
        "\n",

        "After you've implemented the vanilla beam search decoder, it's time to put it to the test and analyze its performance. This part of the assignment is crucial for understanding the behavior of the algorithm under different conditions and recognizing some of the common challenges associated with text generation in NLP.\n",

        "Start by experimenting with your beam search implementation. Try out different input sentences and beam widths (the `k` parameter), and observe how they affect the resulting generated text. You might want to consider questions like:\n",

        "- How does changing the beam width influence the diversity of the output?\n",
        "- What happens if the beam width is set to 1? How about a much larger number?\n",
        "- Do you notice any repetitive patterns or suboptimal text generation?"

        "2. **Diversity of Generated Sequences**:\n",

        "### Enhancing Beam Search with n-gram Blocking and Hamming Diversity Factor\n",
        "\n",
        "Through your experimentation, you might have noticed certain limitations in the plain beam search algorithm. To overcome these, we can integrate advanced techniques such as n-gram blocking and the Hamming diversity factor. Letâ€™s explore these concepts in more detail and see how they can be applied to improve your beam search decoder.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### n-gram Blocking\n",
        "\n",
        "**What is n-gram blocking?**\n",
        "n-gram blocking is a technique used to prevent the model from generating the same sequence of tokens (an n-gram) more than once. An n-gram is a contiguous sequence of `n` tokens from the text. For example, in the sentence \"The cat sat on the mat\", \"the cat sat\" is a 3-gram.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why use n-gram blocking?**\n",
        "It helps mitigate the issue of repetitive loops in the generated text, a common problem where the model outputs the same phrase over and over again. By blocking previously generated n-grams, we force the model to explore new paths and produce more varied and unique sequences.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Hamming Diversity Factor\n",
        "\n",
        "**What is the Hamming diversity factor?**\n",
        "The Hamming diversity factor is a technique that introduces diversity into the beam search by penalizing new sequences that are too similar to any existing sequence in the beam. The Hamming distance measures how many positions two sequences of the same length differ. The diversity factor applies a penalty based on this distance, encouraging the selection of more diverse sequences.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why apply the Hamming diversity factor?**\n",
        "In beam search, there's a risk that all top `k` sequences may become very similar to each other, as they might all share a common prefix. This similarity can reduce the overall diversity of the generated text. By applying the Hamming diversity factor, we encourage the model to generate a set of diverse sequences, potentially covering a wider range of meanings and contexts.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Step by Step Guide\n",
        "\n",
        "- **n-gram Blocking**:\n",

        "  - Read about the mathematical details in this [foundational blog post on BLEU](https://towardsdatascience.com/foundations-of-nlp-explained-bleu-score-and-wer-metrics-1a5ba06d812b).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Tokenization**\n",
        "  - Tokenize both the predicted sentences and the reference sentences. This means splitting each sentence into its constituent words or tokens.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **N-gram Precision Calculation**\n",
        "  - For n-grams of sizes 1 to 4 (unigrams to 4-grams), calculate the precision. Precision is the ratio of the number of matching n-grams in the predicted text to the number of n-grams in the predicted text.\n",
        "  - Use the `ngrams` function from NLTK to generate n-grams from the sentences.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Count Overlapping N-grams**\n",
        "  - For each n-gram size, count the number of n-grams in the predicted text that appear in the reference text. This count is capped by the maximum number of times each n-gram appears in the reference text (to avoid over-counting repeated n-grams).\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Calculate Individual Precisions**\n",
        "  - Divide the count of overlapping n-grams by the total number of n-grams in the predicted text for each n-gram size. This gives you the precision for each n-gram size.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Compute Brevity Penalty**\n",
        "  - The brevity penalty penalizes overly short predicted texts. It's calculated as `exp(1 - r/c)` where `r` is the length of the reference text and `c` is the length of the predicted text. If the predicted text is longer than the reference, the brevity penalty is 1 (no penalty).\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Calculate BLEU Score**\n",
        "  - The final BLEU score is the geometric mean of the four n-gram precisions, multiplied by the brevity penalty. Use the `math` library to calculate the geometric mean.\n",
